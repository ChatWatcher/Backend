only 5 players instead of 6?
It literally looks like they regressed some how
Pvo 
Yeah, i never played overwatch but not sure I will pick this game up LUL
could have just done a massive update on OW1 surely
how to get beta anyone know?
Tim said y‚Äôall playing together next game
is ov1 getting an overall update?
Red shell owns you
redshell has double courage's views rn? wdym 2 viewers LMAO
60$ new hero 
Fortnite looks different today 
lmao that guy is so proud and happy he's got people streaming this shit game
tracer is hard but i also suck 
idk why they made it 1 tank kinda weird
it's the same game
shit game shit company
@Ari Shilani they're changing the graphics but this is a beta so things can change
it‚Äôs because they want new players. 
redshell is the biggest trolling lucio in the game
Better be like $5
man spawncamps everyone
only the pve will cost money
for the PVE yes, not the PVP
if OW2 costs money actual L game 
Yeah
there‚Äôs only been 3 new players since 2016
for the campaign yes, but if you already have overwatch one you get the pvp modes for free
Donation link: https://streamelements.com/couragejd-773/tip
GO CRAZY 
Yes it has a campaign but can play multiplayer on the original one
dont Care Still Play Overwatch Daily
i hope not, this is kind of a joke not to be mean, but who would pay 60$ for this
if its money then not going to do it
@Chad Florence Jr. More like $60 LMAO
anyone get the beta?
wow. The UI barely looks different
i rather stick to the original overwatch
$60 for a campaign???
It will probably free but it is not cnfirmed
graphics look clean tbh
@Krystal Turner it probably would be smh
jack yout the best i love your streams bro 
I'm so excited!
this just looks like regular overwatch
How do u tell when u got the beta
so there is no difference
Courage, ask Tim about his trip to LA this weekend. He won‚Äôt spill any details lol
why
Was watching Tim stream and he is washed so came to watch you papa jack :face_with_tears_of_joy:
When you playing getting over it
I think they just wanted to make it free
you got bodied by a lucio while playinga dps toon that has a self heal lol.. put some respect on the mans name and say it
where you going in 45min
Naw the heroes got changed
noooooooooooooooooooo
Yes
!pet
REDSHELL
Cody Meighan just pet Kaya! :smiling_face_with_hearts::blue_heart: Kaya has been pet by chat 6462 times!
why you are you going in 45min
if youre coming into this expecting a different game youre gonna be disappointed. this is basically what overwatch was originally supposed to be. this is the better version of overwatch
Tims trip seems to be related to nascar or cod according to doc but he won‚Äôt release any details :grinning_face_with_sweat:
We pay 60 dollars for campaign games all the time I don‚Äôt see what everyone‚Äôs problem with it is 
overwatch 2 pvp is free the pve side of overwatch 2 isnt
